# ToDoList
This project is a simple web project to handle ToDo list. It is based on jQuery and a bit of JavaScript file handling.
Go ahead and download or clone the project and use it as your regular ToDoList manager.
The design is elegant. With pretty-looking fontawesome icons, you can do the following stuffs:
1)Add a ToDo
2)Delete a ToDo
3)Update a ToDo
    a)Update the date of entry of ToDo
    b)Update the description of ToDo
    c)Update the deadline of ToDo
4)Mark some ToDo as important

Hope it will make it a lot easier to manage ToDos.
